----Info----
golfTracker.py is a simple program that asks the user for the names of 2 golf players
then asks for the number of strokes they made on each hole, storing the name and
values (as ints) in lists, p1 (player 1) and p2 (player 2), the name of the player is
p1[0] or p2[0]. On p1's turn, the user is given the option to quit. To do this, they 
must type "done" as their input, ValueErrors are handled with an error message and
the loop continues. When a game is ended, the name of the winner and their score is
printed and the user is asked if they want to play again, then the user is asked if
they want to save their score cards to a .txt file, if so, the values from that
game's p1 and p2 are written to a .txt file with the name given by the user.
